# customer-segmentation-and-recommendation

## Overview:
This project aims to develop a personalized product recommendation system for an e-commerce platform. The recommendation system utilizes customer data such as demographic information, purchase history, browsing behavior, and product interactions to suggest relevant products to users. By leveraging machine learning techniques such as clustering and collaborative filtering, the recommendation system aims to improve customer engagement and drive sales on the e-commerce platform.

## Key Features:
* Data Collection: Gathered customer data from the e-commerce platform, including demographic information, purchase history, and product interactions.
* Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and processed the data, performed feature engineering, and encoded categorical features.
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducted EDA to gain insights into the data distribution and relationships between variables.
* Customer Segmentation: Used clustering algorithms to segment customers based on their behavior and preferences.
* Recommendation System Development: Developed a recommendation system using collaborative filtering techniques such as user-based, item-based, or matrix factorization.
* Evaluation: Evaluated the performance of the recommendation system using metrics such as precision, recall, and mean average precision.
* Monitoring and Optimization: Continuously monitored the performance of the recommendation system, gathered feedback from users, and optimized the algorithms based on changing customer preferences.

## Deployment:
The recommendation system can be deployed in a real-world e-commerce environment, integrated with the existing platform to provide personalized product recommendations to customers. It includes features such as a user interface or API for users to interact with the recommendation system and monitoring tools to track key performance metrics.

## Technologies Used:
* Python
* Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn for data preprocessing and modeling
* Surprise library for collaborative filtering
* Matplotlib, Seaborn for data visualization

## Future Improvements:
* Integration with an actual e-commerce platform for deployment and testing.
* Incorporation of additional data sources and features to enhance recommendation accuracy.
* Implementation of advanced recommendation techniques such as deep learning-based models.
